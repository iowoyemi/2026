            <section class="mb-8">
                <p class="mb-4">The basis for this message is Philippians 3:12, which may not seem like the most appropriate verse for the world, but I think it actually is. It goes:</p>

                <div class="verse-block">
                    "Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me."
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4">I remember many years ago sitting in a church service where the pastor related the story of an African king whose best friend he had taken on as his assistant to help him. This friend had a particular habit: whenever anything would go wrong, he would say, "It’s all good."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The king never did anything about it, but one day his friend had loaded some ammunition wrong, and it exploded in the breech of his gun and damaged the king’s hand so that he lost a couple of fingers. The friend looked at him and said, "It’s all good," which wound him up in prison.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">His friend sat there for quite a while until one day the king was out hunting by himself, and he was kidnapped by cannibals. They were about to kill him and cook him, but when they saw his hand, they let him go because he was "damaged goods" and they didn't want to eat him.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">He went back to his friend in the prison to let him out, and he told him of the thing that had befallen him. He apologized, and his friend said, "It’s all good."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The king said, "No, it’s not all good. You rotted in prison all these months. Don't you understand?"</p>

                <p class="mb-4">And the friend said, "Don't you understand? If you hadn't put me in prison, I would have been with you, and I would have been eaten."</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-6 border-b pb-2">Trusting the Divine Logic</h2>
                
                <p class="mb-4">We like to say that God works all things together for our good and His glory, from Romans 8:28. And it is true. And yet, it goes so much deeper than that. Part of belonging to Him, to have His Spirit in us, is trusting Him in the ways that He dictates—that He dictates, not us.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">For if He is trustworthy—and He is—then we should logically trust Him even when it seems counterintuitive, when we want to do something different. But even then, it’s all good.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Why? Well, it has to do with the qualities of God, with who He is.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I had a friend named Johnny Horan who was in prison ministry with us. He had been an electrical contractor living on a golf course. He never had to call for a tee time; he just walked on, and the pro made sure he had a tee. Then he got caught doing some dishonest things and wound up in prison.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">During that time, he became born again. He talked about all the things that Christ had done for him. He was on fire until the day that he passed away.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">But one of the things that Johnny related was that when he got out of prison, he needed transportation. He no longer had a company or a life. He prayed to the Lord, trusting Him. Sure enough, a car came up that was just his style—the right color, lovely, and somewhat affordable.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">He asked, "That’s it! Thank you, Lord, please may I have this car?" And it got sold out from under him.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">When he prayed and trusted the Lord, another car came up. Not nearly as nice, older, kind of beat up. But it was cheaper; he was able to buy it outright, and he drove it for years.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">This was an example of something that God had done for those who trust Him. It may seem inscrutable, impossible to understand. At times while He is doing things, He knows the right way; we don't. We want to know Him and serve Him and feel that He is not doing what we <em>need</em>, but what He <em>wants</em>.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">He knows because while we are playing checkers, He is playing 4D chess. It has to do with who He is in comparison to us.</p>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-6 border-b pb-2">The Unchanging Nature of God</h2>

                <p class="mb-4">Today is "Prison Example Day," and I have another one. In prison ministry, we handed out a chart with some of the attributes of God—the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—and how they lined up. We talked about some of those things, but you could go on for many hours, many days. I’d like to look at just a few of them.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">For example, when God says, <strong>"I am the Lord, I do not change"</strong> in Malachi 3:6, a great weight should be lifted off our shoulders. Why? Because if God wasn't immutable, the way that some of us behave, He might very well just say, "Oh no. No, no, you've crossed the threshold. I don't want that."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">But He doesn't change His mind. The things that He promised us, He keeps those promises.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">When we look at His intelligence, His omniscience, Job 37:16 says, <strong>"Do you know... the wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?"</strong></p>

                <p class="mb-4">Isaiah 42:9 says, <strong>"Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them."</strong></p>

                <p class="mb-4">This is a God who knows everything. So right there, we are dealing with a being who knows not only everything, but where every single atom of His is. That may seem incredible given the expanse of the universe, but He illustrates that for us as well.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I may have mentioned this before, but there was a statistics class in college where the professor set a difficult task. He said, "Here are 38 prophecies of the Lord Jesus' first coming. What are the odds that one man living in that region of the world could fulfill all 38?"</p>

                <p class="mb-4">There were, by some counts, over a hundred prophecies of His first coming, but they just looked at 38. They found that the odds of one man fulfilling all 38 of those prophecies were equal to the estimated number of atoms in the known universe.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">So, no, it is not impossible; it’s not too hard for God to do that.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-6 border-b pb-2">Sovereignty and Grace</h2>

                <p class="mb-4">Now, even though that is very mighty, what if there were other gods just as powerful as Him? The Mormons believe that there are multiple gods with multiple planets. But there aren't.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The answer is that many times in Scripture—for example in Isaiah 45:5—He says, <strong>"I am the Lord, and there is no other; there is no God besides Me."</strong></p>

                <p class="mb-4">So, we have that perfect, all-knowing, unchanging God. All those attributes would terrify us if He weren't the <strong>God of Love</strong>.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Someone once said that the idea of a perfect, all-powerful God sitting on the throne of judgment would be too terrible for us to imagine were it not administered by His Son from the mercy seat, from love.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Because God is kind. Psalm 107:8 says, <strong>"Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men!"</strong></p>

                <p class="mb-4">But He not only acts kindly to us; He <em>thinks</em> of us in loving terms. We are all familiar with Jeremiah 29:11:</p>

                <div class="verse-block">
                    "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope."
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4">The dedication of a perfect God means that everything is done perfectly, powerfully. So when we ask if "it’s all good," even in the bad times, we need to ask: Is God sovereign? Does He rule over all?</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Even the agnostics and the atheists at different points in their lives have to admit that there is something going on—that there is too much order, far too much complexity, for it to just "be an accident." We are too self-aware to just be an accident.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">So then, the question arises: Do we then work our way up to Him in order to be accepted by Him?</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The world is filled with "wannabe sovereigns," isn't it? They are anxious to throw their weight around, expecting their citizens to work toward them to prove how good they are, how much they love the sovereign. They are the cause of a lot of wars.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">But God's word is clear. We all know Ephesians 2:8:</p>

                <div class="verse-block">
                    "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast."
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4">So reality—what is really there—is not like the world's religions where you have to be "good enough." Have you noticed that the religions that say, "Oh, you just have to be so good," are the same ones that call for you to kill people? Many of them. It doesn't make sense.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">But with Christianity, Romans 10:10 says, <strong>"For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."</strong></p>

                <p class="mb-4">That is about as simple as it could be, and yet as effective as it could be. Why? Because behind this formula, there is an all-powerful God who makes it happen. When we ourselves come to salvation, we don't do so alone; the Holy Spirit is the one who gets us across the finish line.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">So what's missing in this? Works? No, they are not part of the equation for salvation.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-6 border-b pb-2">God's Perfect Timing</h2>

                <p class="mb-4">And I know sometimes it's hard not to keep your hands off the throttle; you want to force the outcome. But it is really His timing that happens.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I had a dear friend and coworker named Rose Walker. Rose’s husband was her deep love. But around Christmas time, he had a very annoying habit. You see, he saw the presents under the tree with his name on them, and he couldn't wait to see what they were.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">So every year in the days leading up to Christmas, in the middle of the night, he would sneak downstairs. Rose could hear the quiet <em>rattle, rattle, rattle</em> of gift wrapping coming apart as his curiosity ruined the surprise that was awaiting him.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Christmas morning, he would already know. And he would carefully have re-wrapped all the presents. I don't know how much time he took ruining his surprise!</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I suggested to Rose that she wrap a nice big box. And when he spent time carefully opening it, there would be another box inside that was wrapped. And another box. And another. Until finally he got to this little box, and there would be a note inside that said, "It ain't here, dear."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">If we really trust God, if we honestly love Him, we have to go by His timetable, His schedule. Because He has reasons for the way that He does things that we don't know about. We will know on the other side why a lot of the things that we thought were not right, were actually perfectly right.</p>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-6 border-b pb-2">Perseverance in the Faith</h2>

                <p class="mb-4">The Apostle Paul was and is deeply in love with the Lord, but as he said in Philippians 3, he hadn't gotten to where he wanted to be. "Not that I have already attained." And he hadn't attained. But it sure seemed like he attained more than 99.9% of us!</p>

                <p class="mb-4">He says, "But I press on." His response to expectations not coming the way that he had anticipated or prayed for was to keep going.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Why? <strong>"That I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me."</strong></p>

                <p class="mb-4">If you fly off and away from Christ, He has to bring you back if you are born again. But Paul says, "No. It doesn't make sense. I’m facing 200 Greek pagan philosophers, and the Lord put me here. Wow."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I've given the example before of Janet Parshall, who was a Christian broadcaster. She had been a homemaker, and she got upset with the school board about something. So she wound up on a stage, and there were three non-Christians arguing for a policy in the school, and she was supposed to be with two other ladies.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The other ladies didn't show up. Janet Parshall was three-against-one. Now, she could have given up. But she just kept doing what she knew she had to do. When she got down, she got a standing ovation. Because the Lord had been there.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I may think I've attained something and then find out... I wasn't as holy as I thought I was. And I would suggest to you that that is not failure. It is God's grace.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The more we see that we are not where we want to be in relation to Him, it is because He is honoring our desire for reality and guidance to keep us steering straight toward Him.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">None of us—no, not D.L. Moody or Billy Graham—were nearly as close to God as they wanted to be. They all had horrible things happen to them.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">One of the most famous pastors in American history is Jonathan Edwards. He was a New England pastor and invited George Whitefield to come for an old revival. After thirty-some-odd years as pastor of that church—being lauded and faithful—they voted him out over a communion issue.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">He became a missionary to the Native Americans and then a college president shortly before he died. Do you think that Jonathan Edwards thought, "Oh yeah, I kind of suspected I'd be out visiting Native Americans instead of at my own church"?</p>

                <p class="mb-4">No. But he persevered simply because that was what God had for him. He wasn't perhaps as close as he wanted to be. But that is grace, wonderful grace. Because He is keeping it real. Even Paul still had some fear.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Remember when the Lord said to him in Acts when he was in Corinth, <strong>"Do not fear, Paul"</strong>? Why would He tell the Apostle Paul—that lion of the faith—why would He say that? Because Paul had either a tendency toward fear or was tempted to fear.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">But that's part of the process. We grow to be more like Christ. As we do that, we see our sin more clearly. And yet, in that reality, we find more joy than ever before because He is managing the relationship.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">We may seem like we are going down a dirt road, but we find along the way that we have gathered truth and His love in the process. So we trust Him more than we do anything or anyone else—even our own feelings and desires.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-6 border-b pb-2">Comforting Others</h2>

                <p class="mb-4">And if instead of focusing on our own personal experience, we ask Him for people that we can help... Oh, there's a thought! To whom we can witness and show Christ’s love? We will get them.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">We can fulfill what the Spirit through Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 1:4:</p>

                <div class="verse-block">
                    "[God] who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God."
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4">I'd like to close this morning with the story of an elderly lady who lived near a small village. One day she noticed that her mailbox was slightly ajar. She fished out an envelope that had no stamp on it. She opened it, curious, and with trembling hands, she read:</p>

                <p class="mb-4 font-semibold italic">"Dear Woman, Tomorrow I will come to see you for lunch. Love, Jesus."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">She knew it wasn't a joke. Her Lord Jesus, whom she had always wanted to get closer to, was coming to see <em>her</em>. The one-on-one that she had been waiting for. So she cleaned her house. She got up early the next morning and cleaned her house again.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">And then she went into the village and spent all her money buying meats that she never would have dared buy for herself—cheese, finest bread, and dessert. When she had spent everything, she grabbed it all up, put it on her shoulder and in her hands—barely able to carry it all—and she headed up to the door of the shop toward home.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">But as she passed by an alleyway, she was aware of a man and a woman and two children huddled against the building in the alley. They looked exhausted and thin. She felt her feet turning away from the direction that she meant to go. Her knees poured down.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">She found that they were poor and starving. She put down her bags of delicacies and left them there for the family to feast on. She made sure that they knew that this was Jesus's meal.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">And when she dragged home, stricken with horror at what she had done—what she would have to say to the Lord, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings—that she had, on a whim, given all she had for some wretches in the street.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">She arrived home trembling again, but this time in fear. As she passed the mailbox, she saw it was again slightly ajar. And inside, she found an envelope just like yesterday's. Trembling, knowing that He knew what she had done, she began to read the few lines:</p>

                <p class="mb-4 font-semibold italic">"Dear Woman, Thanks for the lunch. Love, Jesus."</p>
