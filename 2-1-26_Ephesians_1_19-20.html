                <p>Nothing is more frustrating. Is that playing just so beautiful? Thank you so much. [cite_start]It just kind of sets our hearts right before we get into the word of God. [cite: 5, 6]</p>
                <p>I'd like for you to turn with me in your Bibles this morning to Ephesians chapter 1. I recognize that for some of you, you're just coming into this study in the letter to the Ephesians, and so there might be a little bit of catching up to do. [cite_start]We'll do that over the next few weeks, but we're going to continue on where we left off. [cite: 7, 8]</p>
                [cite_start]<p>Ephesians chapter 1 will begin at verse 15. [cite: 9]</p>

                    "Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. [cite_start]And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all." [cite: 10, 11]

                [cite_start]<p>Let's pray. [cite: 12]</p>
                <p>Father, we recognize as we hear Your word that there must be a work of the Spirit to give to us understanding. There must be a work of the Spirit to open our eyes—the eyes of our heart, the eyes of our understanding. And that the mighty powerful work of Your Spirit would be taking place within our lives and transforming us into the image of Your wonderful Son, Jesus. And it is in His name we pray. [cite_start]Amen. [cite: 13-16]</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-6 border-b-2 border-indigo-100 pb-2">The Weak Link: Technology vs. Spirit</h2>
                <p>I'm just going to start this morning with a simple question: Have you ever noticed how humbling technology can be? Let's take the smartphone. Sometimes my smartphone makes me feel stupid. [cite_start]I am certain that I am not alone. [cite: 19, 20]</p>
                <p>But I did hear about a guy who had his smartphone for many years, and even though he'd had it for so many years, he discovered a feature that he never knew that he had. Can you relate to that? As it turns out, his phone battery was constantly dying, and he was getting so frustrated. [cite_start]He began to complain to his friend, saying, "You know, my phone battery is just always dying." [cite: 21-24]</p>
                <p>And his friend said, "Well, just turn on low power mode." And he said, "My phone doesn't have that." He didn't argue with him; he just took his phone, swiped up, pushed a button, the screen changed, and he handed it back. And the man said, "Wow." [cite_start]He said, "Technology isn't the weak link. It's me. I am the weak link." [cite: 25-27]</p>
                <p>This translates into our spiritual life within the church. We're like the guy—we have to admit the weak link is us. [cite_start]Within the life of the believer, there is so often this weak link where we don't understand, we don't use, and we don't relate to the power and all that God has given to us. [cite: 28, 29]</p>
                <p>Paul, recognizing this, is praying for the church at Ephesus. Part of his prayer is that these believers would begin to understand, begin to use, and begin to live in the power of God. [cite_start]He didn't pray that they would <em>have</em> the power; he recognized that they already <em>had</em> God's power, but they didn't understand it. [cite: 30-33]</p>
                [cite_start]<p>So often, when it comes to God's power, many believers—after 10 or 15 years going to church, attending Bible studies—say, "Well, I didn't know I had that." [cite: 34]</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-6 border-b-2 border-indigo-100 pb-2">Opening the Eyes of the Heart</h2>
                <p>In verse 16, he says, "I do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him." [cite_start]We need that to tie verse 17 to verse 18 because then it goes on: "The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling." [cite: 37, 38]</p>
                <p>What does it really mean to have the "eyes of the understanding" opened? Physically, we rely upon our eyesight from the moment we wake up until we go to bed. Some of us were blessed with 20/20 vision. Some of you must first put on a pair of glasses. [cite_start]Others, you wear contacts. [cite: 39-42]</p>
                <p>You know Chuck, Pastor Chuck? He's a very funny guy. But did you know that is an inherited behavior? There was somebody at least as funny, if not funnier, before Chuck, and that was his father. Chuck's dad used to come to this church before he went to be with the Lord. [cite_start]By the time he went to be with the Lord, he was completely blind. [cite: 43-46]</p>
                <p>And he used to say this: "I put on my glasses in the morning, and then I'd have to put my contacts in so I could see my glasses." Just funny. [cite_start]Putting on your contacts so you could see to your glasses. [cite: 47, 48]</p>
                <p>There is a spiritual side of us that has sight, and it is independent of our physical nature. That spiritual nature that you have as a believer was formerly dead. Before you trusted in Jesus, the Bible said it is dead. [cite_start]The Apostle Paul explains this in the next chapter, Ephesians 2:1: "And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins." [cite: 49-52]</p>
                <p>God had warned the first human He created, Adam, about spiritual death. [cite_start]The Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of that tree you shall die." [cite: 53, 54]</p>
                <p>Adam failed to heed the commandment of God. Adam ate of the tree. Adam died. Physically? No. But spiritually, there was a spiritual death. What that means is that the relationship with God that Adam had enjoyed was severed. God is a Holy God, and God cannot have a spiritual relationship with sinful men. Adam died that day. Every human since Adam is born and takes on a body that has a sin nature. [cite_start]The death of the spiritual man spread from Adam throughout all of humanity. [cite: 55-60]</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-6 border-b-2 border-indigo-100 pb-2">The Exceeding Greatness of His Power</h2>
                <p>After coming to Jesus, you can see, you can know, you can understand, you can discern that which you never understood before. But we all still have a problem. [cite_start]The problem is this: We have the spiritual eyes—they may be open to Jesus and salvation—yet the eyes are closed to much of what is available to us through our Lord Jesus Christ, specifically the power of God. [cite: 63, 64]</p>
                <p>And no one comes to Jesus having 20/20 spiritual vision. It's not like you receive Christ and all of a sudden you know everything. Even Jesus, in His humanity—Luke writes, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature." [cite_start]He grew in His understanding. [cite: 65-67]</p>
                <p>Paul is praying for the church... that your understanding—the spiritual eyes—being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling. [cite_start]And specifically in verse 19: "And what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power." [cite: 68, 69]</p>
                <p>That goes beyond just intellectual processes. That goes beyond memorizing scripture. This is beyond attending church. [cite_start]Paul is praying for revelation and an understanding of what God has already given to you. [cite: 70, 71]</p>
                <p>Let's look at verse 19. "What is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe?" That word "exceeding" in the Greek is a compound word: <em>Hyperballo</em>. <em>Hyper</em> means abundance or beyond. <em>Ballo</em> means to throw. [cite_start]So the word exceeding comes from these two Greek words, and it means "to throw beyond the usual mark." [cite: 72-74]</p>
                <p>Those of you who love sports, you can relate to this. You know how the field goal kicker knows his maximum distance. But then there is a game, and the pressure is on. His team is behind two points. There are only seconds left on the clock. It's all up to him. The problem is, the goal is about 10 yards beyond what he has ever kicked before. But the ball is snapped, and he comes and he kicks, and the ball goes sailing through the uprights. It's a record for him. It's something he's never done before. It's <em>beyond the mark</em>. [cite_start]That is the idea of this word <em>exceeding</em>. [cite: 75-82]</p>
                <p>But that's not enough when describing the power of God toward you. It's exceeding, but the next word, "greatness," in the Greek language is <em>Megathos</em>. That's where we get the word <em>Mega</em>. [cite_start]God's power in you is not just exceeding; it is <em>Mega</em> beyond the mark. [cite: 83-86]</p>
                <p>Paul goes on: "according to the working of His mighty power." He's adding word onto word, description onto description. He's building up the power of God. That word "power" literally means "might." So really what it is, is "mighty might." That's the literal translation. [cite_start]It is the Mega, Mighty Might beyond anything we've ever done—the power of God. [cite: 87-90]</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-6 border-b-2 border-indigo-100 pb-2">Application: Resurrection Power in Us</h2>
                <p>Verse 20 gives us the demonstration. He said, "Here is the demonstration of what I'm writing about. It's the same power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places." It's the resurrection power. It's the power that takes that which is dead and brings it to life. [cite_start]And he said, "That's the power of God working toward you and in you." [cite: 93-95]</p>
                <p>Now, God does not empower us to do what He has not called us to do. But under the power of God, we are like the Apostle Paul, who put it this way: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." I like to point out that the word "all" means <em>all</em>. [cite_start]Paul is referring to all that God has given him to do. [cite: 96-99]</p>
                <p>It doesn't mean physical strength—I remember a number of weeks back talking about Brother Al going to the gym and squatting 600 pounds. Suppose I take Paul's word and say, "I can do all things," and I walk up to Al and say, "I can curl that for 10 reps." I can't do it. Because when God talks about power, He isn't promising Superman on demand. It means God's power brings you to life spiritually. [cite_start]He wants to use you for His glory. [cite: 100-103]</p>
                <p>But some of the things He wants you to do, you're going to say, "I can't do it." Think of David going up against the giant. Think of Gideon going up against the tens and tens of thousands of Midianites. Gideon was a farmer! God wouldn't even allow him to gather enough men to launch a military campaign. [cite_start]And yet, in the power of God, they defeated the army. [cite: 104-107]</p>
                <p>Think about the disciples. The followers of Jesus. These simple, uneducated fishermen called to evangelize the world. Acts chapter 4 verse 13 says: "Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus." [cite_start]What changes the world around us is simple people who have been with Jesus. [cite: 108-110]</p>
                <p>I'll close with this. There has been an armadillo attacking our yard. You can see it during the day. Darlene loves the yard; she loves the plants. [cite_start]To see an armadillo out there poking holes... she was chasing that armadillo with a shovel! [cite: 111, 112]</p>
                <p>Then one day, she is looking at the armadillo, and she notices something different. Its eyes are closed. This is an armadillo that is blind. It can't see. Darlene felt bad. She felt so bad that she had been hounding this armadillo. She had compassion on it. We named it Bartimaeus. [cite_start]"Blind Bartimaeus." [cite: 113-116]</p>
                <p>I thought, you know, this is a great sermon illustration. The blindness that we have—the things that we can't see—I don't know that you realize that it really grieves the heart of God. Of all that He gives to us, the power He enables us with, and yet we don't see it. [cite_start]We don't use it. [cite: 117-120]</p>
                <p>I believe that God has this heart of compassion. It is yours. Paul is praying, and he's saying, "My prayer for you is that the eyes of your heart being enlightened, that we could see." [cite_start]God says, "It's yours. Take it. Use it for My glory." [cite: 121-123]</p>
                <p>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. The power of God in Jesus' name. [cite_start]Amen. [cite: 124]</p>
