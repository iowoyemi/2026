            <article>
                <p>Lamentations Chapter 3. Jeremiah is the author of Lamentations. These two verses that we are going to be looking at this morning are like a very beautiful light within a very dark context. This was written during probably one of the darkest seasons of Jerusalem's history, specifically Judah, the Southern Kingdom of Israel.</p>
                
                <p>Last week we talked about the constancy of God, meaning that God never changes. The Lord said, "I am the Lord, and I do not change." What that means is that the character of God is fixed, and the purposes of God are fixed; we can depend upon God. I believe we have a tendency sometimes to adjust our perception of God depending upon the circumstances that we are going through.</p>

                <p>When we feel good about our circumstances, we think, "Well, I'm all good with God, and God is good with us." But then when things begin to fall apart, sometimes our perception of God is that God has failed us. This morning, we will see how God is unwavering in His love, He is unwavering in His compassion, He is unwavering in His mercy, and He is unwavering in His faithfulness.</p>

                <p>We look at Lamentations chapter 3, beginning at verse 22.</p>

                <div class="bible-verse">
                    "Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness."

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">The Historical Context of Judgment</h2>
                
                <p>The prophet Jeremiah was an eyewitness to this exceptionally low point in the history of the Southern Kingdom of Israel, or Judah. Jerusalem was the capital. Jeremiah had been warning against the sin of the people and the need for repentance. For decades he had warned them. The people refused to repent from their sin, and finally, God used Babylon, specifically King Nebuchadnezzar, as His instrument of judgment against the sins of Judah.</p>

                <p>The city of Jerusalem was completely ransacked. Solomon's Temple, which we talked about last week, was utterly destroyed. Everyone who was not slaughtered was taken away captive, with the exception of the very poorest of those allowed to remain.</p>

                <p>We read about that in 2 Kings 24:14:</p>

                <div class="bible-verse">
                    "He carried away into captivity all Jerusalem, all the captains, all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land."
                </div>

                <p>Jeremiah was initially among those captives, but he was released and given the choice to either go to Babylon or remain in the city of Jerusalem. He looked around and understood how dire the situation was, yet he chose to remain in Jerusalem. What Jeremiah witnessed is beyond our imagination. He saw the bodies of the dead lying in the streets. He saw the remains of the great Temple of Solomon destroyed.</p>

                <p>Even worse than the murder and destruction was the famine that ensued. We discover later in Lamentations that the famine was so severe that mothers were killing their children and using the children for food; cannibalism was extreme. This is the background of this season of Judah's history.</p>

                <p>It is during this time that Jeremiah said: "Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness."</p>

                <p class="italic text-gray-500 mt-4">[Mic adjustment/transition]</p>
                <p>There are four statements we are going to look at this morning, and each tells us something crucial to our understanding of how God's nature does not change.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">1. God’s Mercy Spares Us</h2>
                
                <p>The first statement is that God's mercy spares us. Verse 22 says, "Through the Lord's mercies, we are not consumed". Do you know what that word "consumed" means? It can be translated as "being put to death." But in this passage, it is more like an execution.</p>

                <p>I must admit, maybe you feel this way a little bit too—you read the news in the world and read about what's going on, and don't you sometimes read something that is so bad you just say, "God, judge them. God, put them to death. God, it's time, execute." Some of the crimes and things we see are so heinous that we just can't wrap our imaginations around how low people can go, and we say, "God, send your judgment."</p>

                <p>What we discover is that God is patient beyond measure. God's patience is far beyond my patience; His patience is beyond your patience. We think that because the moral climate has become so dark, God would somehow become less merciful. But the truth is that we are all deserving of the judgment of God. According to the perfect, holy standard of God, we are all deserving of this same execution that Jeremiah writes about.</p>

                <p>Verse 22 applies to all of us: "Through the Lord’s mercies, we are not consumed." The word "we" was actually added by the translators, but the Hebrew is one word: <strong>consumed</strong>. However, the context of the passage implies that Jeremiah included himself. The great prophet Jeremiah included himself when he said, "We are not consumed."</p>

                <p>We have this little problem as Christians: We compartmentalize the mercy of God. We have two boxes for the mercy of God: the box that <em>we</em> are in, and the box of <em>others</em>. We want God's mercy for ourselves, but when we look around the world, we don't necessarily desire that God have mercy on others. So we put God in a box: "God, look at what they've done." And we think, "I've never done anything like that. I'm not as deserving of the judgment of God as they are."</p>

                <p>But listen to what the Psalmist wrote:</p>

                <div class="bible-verse">
                    "If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared." (Psalm 130:3-4)
                </div>

                <p>Later in that same Psalm, the Psalmist declares, "O Israel, hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is abundant redemption". Someone said what we need most is the mercy of God, or justice would ruin us. So we look at this and say, "Praise God, because I'm included within the mercies of the Lord."</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">2. God’s Compassions Do Not Fail</h2>
                
                <p>There is a second statement that tells us something about God's compassionate nature. It tells us that it cannot fail. That is the constancy of God.</p>
                
                <p>Verse 22 continues: "...because His compassions fail not". If God were fallible, He could not be God. So when we look at the nature of God, anything that we see pertaining to God, we know that it cannot fail. The holiness of God will never fail. The sovereignty of God will never fail. The love of God will never fail. The wisdom of God will never fail.</p>
                
                <p>You could go on and on throughout all of the attributes of God, and you will recognize that God does not change and God will never fail. Whatever the Word of God has to say about the nature of God, it is perfect, it is infallible, and it cannot fail.</p>
                
                <p>Now, that is not true of you and me. We are far from it. We struggle with attributing unfailing compassion to the nature of God because we struggle with it ourselves. You and I may experience patience for a while. We forgive once. We forgive twice. If we forgive a third time, we think we've done really well. But we do run out of patience.</p>
                
                <p>As you know, I enjoy the study of human biology, and I've lately been studying sleep. Have you ever noticed that when you are lacking in sleep, you are less patient? Is that just me, or is there anyone else here that would raise your hand or say "Amen" to that? When you don't get enough sleep, you're less patient with others.</p>
                
                <p>I notice it the most when I'm driving. I can be driving down the freeway, and if I've gotten plenty of sleep and I'm feeling good, and somebody cuts me off, I'm like, "Ah, I'll let it go. I handled that pretty well." But if I'm on three or four hours of sleep and you do the same thing? Oh, I tell you, I might lay it on! I lay on the horn and think, "Now why did I do that?"</p>
                
                <p>Well, it's just our nature. Thankfully, there is the fruit of the Spirit, and one of those is patience, and I sometimes, if I haven't had enough sleep, rely more on that fruit. I wonder, how does God do it? How does the Lord have this infinite patience with us?</p>
                
                <p>Because you know what the Psalmist wrote? "Behold, He who keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep" (Psalm 121:4). And I'm like, "God doesn't even doze off!" Yet His compassion never fails. It is the constancy of the compassion of God.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">3. God’s Mercies are New Every Morning</h2>
                
                <p>There is a third statement that we see here. It tells us something about the abundance of God's mercy, and that is that every day there is just this wonderful, fresh supply.</p>
                
                <p>Look with me at verse 23: "They" —being the mercies of God— "are new every morning". What a revelation to the prophet Jeremiah. He is expressing the total despair of Judah, but when God brings to the heart of Jeremiah this reality, Jeremiah sees the mercies of God. Then God takes Jeremiah even deeper. He reveals to Jeremiah that His mercies are continually being poured out. There is no limit to the mercies of God; they are infinite. God supplies His mercies; they are fresh, they are new every morning.</p>
                
                <p>You're going to ask the question: Why every morning? Why is it in the morning? For that matter, someone might even ask, "Why do I need God's mercies every day? I did really good yesterday. I didn't need God's mercy yesterday. Can't I kind of keep some credit? Can't I use yesterday's supply?"</p>
                
                <p>Our problem is that we trivialize human behavior every day. We think that God looks upon our behavior the way we look upon our own behavior. But God does not see common behaviors the same way that you and I see them.</p>
                
                <p>James, writing to the church, drives this home. James writes in chapter 2, verse 8:</p>

                <div class="bible-verse">
                    "If you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself,' you do well. But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
                </div>
                
                <p>If you show partiality. Do you know what partiality means? If you show favor to one person over another. If you respect <em>this</em> person over <em>that</em> person. If you show more favor or respect to this person than you do another person, according to James, you have broken this royal law of love.</p>
                
                <p>I thought about that. It is very common for us to show partiality. It's just inborn, inbred within us. We will look at the way someone dresses, we may look at how they drive, we may look at where they live, we may look at their education. And it is very common for us to show partiality. James writes, if you do that, you've sinned.</p>
                
                <p>And you say, "Oh, that's a little sin." So then what we do is we take our sins that we consider to be little sins, and we compare them to the bigger sins, and we say, "That's just not so bad." But you know, the Holy Spirit seems to have anticipated that response from us. So James went on to reply in verse 10: "For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all".</p>
                
                <p>You and I need a fresh supply of God's mercies every day. And I'll tell you what, there is probably not one day that goes by that we don't need them, that we don't use them. Jeremiah is overwhelmed by the goodness of God, the mercies of God; they are new every morning.</p>

            <article>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">4. Great is His Faithfulness</h2>
                
                <p>And then there is number four. And that is that God is faithful. Lamentations chapter 3, verse 23: "They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness". That word faithfulness, the idea is fidelity. We think of fidelity as the faithfulness within a marriage relationship. Just as God is perfect in all of His ways, God is perfect in His faithfulness. It is not possible for God to be unfaithful.</p>
                
                <p>Jeremiah is overwhelmed by the faithfulness of God. God was merciful to Judah. The mercies kept flowing from God, and that they were new every morning. But there is something else I believe that is taking place in this proclamation concerning God's faithfulness.</p>
                
                <p>Think with me just for a moment what it would be like to be in the shoes of Jeremiah. You were walking down the streets of Jerusalem. You look down and you see people, the corpses lying along the streets, not having yet been buried. You see the smoke that is arising. You look at the Temple of Solomon, and it is completely destroyed; it has been dismantled. You look around you and what's left is the homeless. What's left is the poor. What's left is those who already had nothing to begin with. What's left is those who are now desperate and that they are starving and that they are willing to put to death their own children in order to feed themselves.</p>
                
                <p>You look around and you see this. And I thought about it, and I thought, you know, with all of our technology, news is instant. We see news all around the world any time of the day. When there's a catastrophe, we see it immediately. But have you ever seen anything like this? Have you ever turned on the news and seen such utter destruction and famine and poverty and that there's really just nothing left? This is beyond our imagination.</p>
                
                <p>Yet in the midst of all this chaos, Jeremiah makes this incredible affirmation: "Great is Your faithfulness." I would think that Jeremiah would say something more like, "You know God, You failed us. God, You let us down. Our enemies have destroyed us. God, they have taken the best of Your people into captivity. God, we are ruined."</p>
                
                <p>I do believe it is in our human DNA to be very present-minded. Have you noticed that when something is going on in your life and it's really bad, it's just like you become absorbed with what's taking place in your life at that moment? We are present-minded. We look at our circumstances, and many times we look at God and we think of God in relation to what is going on right now.</p>
                
                <p>We ask ourselves: How is it that Jeremiah could look at all the destruction and proclaim the faithfulness of God? There was something that made Jeremiah different. I want to examine that this morning. Let's see if that same difference that applied to Jeremiah does not apply to you and I as well.</p>
                
                <p>We all know about Daniel. You've read Daniel. Did you know that Daniel was alive and he was just a young man when Jerusalem was ransacked by the Babylonians? He was taken captive. We all know of the story of Daniel, how he was taken to Babylon and he was given favor by Nebuchadnezzar while in captivity.</p>
                
                <p>But it's in Daniel chapter 9. Now he's an older man. Daniel writes: "I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of years specified by the word of the Lord through Jeremiah..." I understand, as I was reading Jeremiah, that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</p>
                
                <p>You might say Daniel was reading the Bible that he had. Daniel understood that God had a timeline and that the destruction of Israel was just one chapter in the history of the nation, the people of Judah.</p>
                
                <p>When Jeremiah made that amazing proclamation, "Great is Thy faithfulness," I don't believe that he was focused on the present circumstances. I don't think that Jeremiah was looking around at all the destruction and saying, "Oh, great is Thy faithfulness." There was something more that was going on. Like Daniel, Jeremiah was able to see the present circumstances through the lens of God's Word, which goes beyond the present.</p>
                
                <p>Judah's destruction, that was the consequence of their refusal to repent. Jeremiah had been warning them for decades, and Jeremiah was, you know, he had already written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of the total destruction that he witnessed. But God's plan did not end with the destruction of Jerusalem. God had also revealed to Jeremiah the restoration of all that had been destroyed.</p>
                
                <p>Jerusalem would once again thrive. The Temple would be rebuilt. Those in captivity would return. But it was a 70-year period of dispersion. Just as Daniel was looking back at the end of the 70 years, Jeremiah was looking forward at this time to the fulfillment of God's word.</p>
                
                <p>And here is where there is, I think for us, the invaluable lesson. We've been talking about the constancy of God. We've been talking about the nature of God; He does not change. His promises, they can never fail. Jeremiah knew the Word of God. Jeremiah believed in the infallible nature of God, and Jeremiah was looking forward. He was looking beyond the present circumstances. In fact, Jeremiah had already heard from the Lord about the future, and that is why we have some of the beautiful promises that we have in the Word of God.</p>
                
                <p>How about this one? How many of you go to this promise? Jeremiah 29:11:</p>
                
                <div class="bible-verse">
                    "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope."
                </div>
                
                <p>So Jeremiah, he had already received that promise before the destruction of Jerusalem. So Jeremiah is now looking forward to, you know, what God has done and the recognition that it was the consequence—God had just simply done what God said He would do. But Jeremiah understood that that was not the end. And it is by this Scripture that we understand that God will carry us through the present circumstances, that we will arrive on the other end of our circumstances victorious in the promises of God.</p>
                
                <p>That is why we must know God's Word. We must know and we must understand passages such as Isaiah 41:10: "Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand". We need to know, and we need to trust, and we need to believe.</p>
                
                <p>Then we can turn to the Psalms and we read this Psalm that we all know so well, the 23rd Psalm: "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." Why? "For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me".</p>
                
                <p>And then we begin to see God as the Good Shepherd who never leaves us. And He is always there. We do not live in denial of circumstances. God does not call us to live in denial of reality. What God is calling you and I to do is to live with assurance that He is there and that He has a plan. And that's where Jeremiah was when Jeremiah says, "Great is Thy faithfulness."</p>
                
                <p>He's just, "Oh God, you know, You are so faithful. You have already promised me that You know the plans that I have for you." A plan for a hope and for a future, and I can hold onto that. And Jeremiah did hold on to that. And he said, "Oh Lord, I can look forward and I can say great is Thy faithfulness."</p>
                
                <p>Great is the faithfulness of God. God is constant in His mercies; they are new every morning. God is constant in His compassion. He will never fail to be compassionate in our weakness. God is constant in His faithfulness. And I'll tell you, together, I believe we can all proclaim and we can agree and we can say it together: Great is Your faithfulness.</p>
                
                <p>Great is the faithfulness of God.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Closing Prayer</h2>
                <p>Father in Heaven, we thank You that we have Your Word that we can go to and that we have Your promises before us. Even in our very hand, we can go at any time and we can come into this Word and see what You have promised to us. And we know Your nature does not change with circumstances. And we trust You. And we are so thankful. Great is Your faithfulness. In Jesus' name. Amen.</p>

                <p>Let's stand together. Take a hold of the Word of God and just allow it to be real in your life. Don't just come and sit and say it's just another nice sermon. It's more. It's God's Word, and it is alive, and it will work amazing—I mean, it's miraculous what it will do in your life.</p>
                
                <p>And before this sermon, I was thinking as I was reading in the news of the different, the tragedy in America, and you see it every day on the streets when you see people strung out on something, laying on the streets. Their escape from reality. And people turn to drugs, they turn to alcohol, they turn to all, any substance that will alter reality, and they further destroy their lives.</p>
                
                <p>And we recognize that we need something more. We have the Word of God, and we place our hope in this Word, and we can go through these circumstances. We don't need our mind to be altered; we need our heart to be altered by the Word of God, by the Spirit of God. And this Word can do that. And so we trust in God's word and these wonderful promises for this new year.</p>
                
                <p>If you are here this morning and you would like prayer and there is anything going on that you just would like some of the men to just pray over you, we invite you to come down this morning as we close the service. We'll have a couple of men here at the front; I'll be at the front.</p>
                
                <p>If you have never received Jesus, oh, don't, you know, this is... everything we've talked about, it doesn't have meaning unless you have Jesus first. You must have—that's the first assurance you need is to know that you are saved. And so we would invite you to come down, and we will pray with you.</p>
                
                <p>But may the Lord bless you, and may He keep you in His love and in His Word and in this assurance that the promises of God will never fail. You can hold onto them. In Jesus' name. Amen.</p>
